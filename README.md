### My Personal Website

After a long wait I finally decided to put together a website. The project includes a blog, a space to publish my projects, and also a space to have my CV displayed.

I intend to have the wire-framing, prototyping, photoshop files and plain HTML/CSS files uploaded to this repo. I need to compress them first as the files are quire large. They will eventually be available.

As I have trained on Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I have chosen them as my options to build this project.

My website can is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and can be seen [here](https://charlesdebarros.herokuapp.com/).
