    <p>Hello and thank you for stopping by. My name is Charles.</p>
    <p>I'm a <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> graduate and former Senior Network Administrator. I'm also a Rubyist, Rails admirer, Test Driven Development advocate and overal technology explorer. My aim is to learn at least one new thing every single day.</p>
    <p>I am a natural explorer. I like to find out how things work and what makes them tick. I enjoy putting things apart and putting them back together. Though sometimes I am left with a few "spare" bits. But that does not happen only to me, does it? </p>
