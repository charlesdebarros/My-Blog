    <p>Hello and thank you for stopping by. My name is Charles.</p>
    <p>Before you continue, please keep in mind that <strong><em>I am in the process of redoing this site</em></strong> so please forgive me if something is broken and I missed it. Drop me a line and I will strive to have it fixed it as quickly as I can. Thank you.  ;)

    <p>I'm a <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> graduate and former Senior Network Administrator. I'm also a Rubyist, Rails admirer, Test Driven Development advocate and overal technology explorer. My aim is to learn at least one new thing every single day.</p>
    <p>I am a natural explorer. I like to find out how things work and what makes them tick. I enjoy putting things apart and putting them back together. Though sometimes I am left with a few "spare" bits. But that does not happen only to me, does it? </p>
    <p>I love writing code. What interests me most about software and web development is their dynamism. Nothing stays the same for a long period of time, everything is useful and recyclable, and nobody knows everything about everything. Writing code keeps me on my toes and that is a good thing. It pushes me forwards. It keeps me curious and I consider writing code as one of my daily pleasures. It does indeed drive me insane sometimes and I love the feeling.</p>
